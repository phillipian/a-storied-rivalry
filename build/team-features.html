While Andover holds a strong record of 11-6-1, Exeter&rsquo;s stands at 4-8-5.</p><p>Despite the difference in records, Andover tied Exeter 2-2 last year, and the matchup between the two has been historically close.</p><p>Andover will not only look to take down its rivals, but also boost its chances of playing in the Nepsac post-season tournament.</p><p>Co-Captain Cassie Chin &rsquo;17 said, &ldquo;Exeter is always an important game for us for a number of reasons. They are a Class A team, so how we do against them does play a role in making the tournament. A win against our rival also really impacts our energy and confidence. If we continue into the postseason play, having a win against a good team like Exeter will hype us up and give us good momentum.&rdquo;</p><p>The team enters its final regular season game with depth on its roster, strong team chemistry, and a season full of preparation for this moment.</p><p>&ldquo;We have a lot of experience on the field.

The two teams are slated to produce a thrilling contest, despite Exeter&rsquo;s record of 5-8-3.</p><p>Last year, Andover came out victorious with a narrow 3-2 win over Exeter. The two teams guarantee a closely matched game year after year.</p><p>This season, Andover has earned four wins and a draw against the five teams that Exeter has beaten. To add to this, Andover has won three games against the five teams that beat Exeter.</p><p>Co-Captain Peter Heckendorn &rsquo;17 said, &ldquo;I know statistically we are supposed to be much better than Exeter, but in a game like [Andover/Exeter], records kind of go out the window. We can&rsquo;t rely on past results, we have to treat Saturday as its own contest. That said, I&rsquo;m confident that the work we have done all season will show on the field this weekend.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>With an entire season of preparation and work leading up to this game, Andover looks to claim a win at home on Saturday to improve its chances of earning a spot in the playoffs.</p><p>Co-Captain Henry Meyerrose &rsquo;17 said, &ldquo;Andover/Exeter is a big game regardless of previous wins and losses.

Both teams have posted strong records this season, with Andover standing at 9-5 and Exeter at 7-4.</p><p>Although Andover beat Exeter 3-2 in its midseason matchup last season, Exeter ultimately defeated Andover 3-1 during the Andover/Exeter game and later knocked Andover out of playoffs in postseason play. Despite last year&rsquo;s losses to Exeter, Andover hopes to come out strong against Exeter in its final game of regular season play.</p><p>In an email to <em>The Phillipian</em>, Head Coach Clyfe Beckwith said, &ldquo;I take it year-by-year, day-by-day, match-by-match. Andover and Exeter rarely are not compatible and either team has the chance to beat the other at any time.rldquo;</p><p>Andover&rsquo;s determination and passion have driven it to a three-game win streak leading up to the matchup with its rival. Beckwith said, &ldquo;What we need to do this coming Saturday is play our own match. If we play like we have practiced lately we should at minimum be competitive.rldquo;</p><p>Serena Liu &rsquo;19 said, &ldquo;I am very excited to keep this long lasting Andover/Exeter rivalry by representing Andover on the volleyball court.

However, anything can happen on one of the biggest stages in prep school sports, and both teams will look to employ shrewd offensive and defensive strategies in order to secure the victory.</p><p>Andover&rsquo;s offense relies greatly on passing and making big plays. However, Andover&rsquo;s defense will be looking out for Exeter&rsquo;s quarterback, Jake Smith PEA &rsquo;17, who has been a huge asset to the team, especially due to his tendency to scramble.</p><div class="quote"><blockquote>&ldquo;Exeter has some explosive players.
