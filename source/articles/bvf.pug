  p Although Andover Football holds the historical edge over Phillips Exeter Academy with a record of 72-54-10, the rivalry this year will once again be competitive and closely matched.
  p Andover has fared better than its rival this season, posting a record of 2-5 compared to Exeter&rsquo;s 0-7-1. However, anything can happen on one of the biggest stages in prep school sports, and both teams will look to employ shrewd offensive and defensive strategies in order to secure the victory.
  p Andover&rsquo;s offense relies greatly on passing and making big plays. However, Andover&rsquo;s defense will be looking out for Exeter&rsquo;s quarterback, Jake Smith PEA &rsquo;17, who has been a huge asset to the team, especially due to his tendency to scramble.
