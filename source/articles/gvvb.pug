  p Following a disheartening 3-0 loss against Phillips Exeter Academy earlier this season, Andover Girls Volleyball looks for revenge this Saturday. Both teams have posted strong records this season, with Andover standing at 9-5 and Exeter at 7-4.
  p Although Andover beat Exeter 3-2 in its midseason matchup last season, Exeter ultimately defeated Andover 3-1 during the Andover/Exeter game and later knocked Andover out of playoffs in postseason play. Despite last year&rsquo;s losses to Exeter, Andover hopes to come out strong against Exeter in its final game of regular season play.

  p In an email to #[em The Phillipian], Head Coach Clyfe Beckwith said, &ldquo;I take it year-by-year, day-by-day, match-by-match. Andover and Exeter rarely are not compatible and either team has the chance to beat the other at any time.&rdquo;
  p Andover&rsquo;s determination and passion have driven it to a three-game win streak leading up to the matchup with its rival. Beckwith said, &ldquo;What we need to do this coming Saturday is play our own match. If we play like we have practiced lately we should at minimum be competitive.&rdquo;
