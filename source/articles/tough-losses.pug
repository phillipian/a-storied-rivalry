  h3 Tough Losses
  p After a season of preparation and anticipation, nothing dampens the mood of A/E Weekend like a loss to Exeter.
  p &ldquo;All I remember was it was bitterly cold and they were beating us so badly that near the end they let me get into the game as a quarterback, and my ankles were practically frozen. The ground was frozen. Your cleats couldn&rsquo;t even get in there. It was really, besides losing so badly, a bitterly cold day,&rdquo; said Bassett.

  p Though Andover now exclusively plays high school teams, such as Brooks, Salisbury, Deerfield, and Loomis Chaffee, that has not always been the case. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Andover played few games against other high schools. Instead, it faced a schedule laden with college freshman teams.
  p &ldquo;The only prep-school team that we played was Exeter. We played Mass Maritime freshmen, Harvard freshmen, Wesleyan freshmen, Amherst freshmen, Springfield freshmen, and Tufts freshmen,&rdquo; said Bixby.

  p Gil Bamford &rsquo;58, who captained Andover&rsquo;s football team in 1957, said, &ldquo;We played a lot of college freshman teams in those days. In fact, we basically played Exeter and I think that was it. My Senior year we played Exeter, Deerfield, and Hermon, but the rest of the games were against&hellip; the smaller colleges that had freshman teams in those days.&rdquo;
  p Bassett, who played four years of football at Andover, said, &ldquo;Before I got [to Andover]&hellip; in the late forties [and] until probably into the early fifties, they used to play the Ivy League Freshman Teams. They were very serious football in the Ivy Leagues. But then the Ivies got too big, so we played Williams and Amherst and Bowdoin and Northeastern and Tufts. And then Exeter, and then we gradually built in Mount Hermon and Deerfield before the Exeter game. Andover and Exeter didn&rsquo;t play in any prep school league.&rdquo;
  p Because the A/E game was one of the only times during the season that Andover athletes went head-to-head with their peers, the competition was amplified and the severity of a loss was multiplied.

  p Exeter toppled Andover 45-6 on a cold November day in 1956. Exeter&rsquo;s head coach was in his final year at the helm of the Exeter football program and had built a team not only to win, but to dominate.
  p &ldquo;Exeter&rsquo;s coach was going to be retiring that year and so he brought in a major number of Post-Grads, PGs, and the most outstanding one was the quarterback,&rdquo; said Bamford, a member of Andover&rsquo;s 1956 team.
  p &ldquo;That year, Exeter was really loaded. They had a lot of PGs because it was the year that their coach – it was going to be his final year before he retired. So they really loaded up and they had an outstanding group of ball players,&rdquo; Bamford continued.
  p Andover was the clear underdog, and facing an Exeter team full of stars did not bode well after a particularly rough season.

  p &ldquo;We had a poor season leading up to the Exeter game. But that was a big event, not just the Andover/Exeter game, but that was my first year at Andover. And that game was so bitterly cold, the other three games were much more pleasant weather. Oh god, was it cold. All I remember. I don&rsquo;t think I played a game that was that cold ever. Anywhere, in college, or anywhere,&rdquo; said Bassett. He and Bamford overlapped at Andover for two years in the 1950s.
  p In such a tense rivalry, a loss like the one Andover sustained in 1956 is devastating. But the cold – and the loss – did not linger for long.
