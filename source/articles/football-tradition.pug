  h3 The Football Tradition
  p Though each game counts equally towards the final score of A/E day (a tally of games won by both sides), the football game has historically been a stronghold of student interest and attendance.
  p &ldquo;Every team is just as important at Andover&hellip; as the football team. [But the] soccer and field hockey games were done, so we packed our side at Andover for sure against Exeter,&rdquo; said Brennen Keefe &rsquo;88, a Post-Graduate (PG) who played in the 1987 A/E game that Andover won 14-13.
  p &ldquo;Andover&hellip; was a juggernaut&hellip; When I was there, you had a Varsity team and five JV football teams. So, practically everybody in the school&hellip; played football,&rdquo; said Mike Bassett &rsquo;60.
  p Over the course of 136 contests, Andover&rsquo;s football team has emerged victorious 72 times to Exeter&rsquo;s 54. In addition, the schools have tied ten times. Yet no matter who wins or loses, the school spirit that accompanies each weekend of competition with Exeter is exciting in its own right.
